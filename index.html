            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Shania Esguerra and I'm from Alberta, Canada. I was born and raised in the Philippines
                until I was 14 years old. Since then, we have lived here in Canada. I am from a family of four where I
                have only one sibling.
                I have a very loving boyfriend who lives in the Philippines. My family and my boyfriend are the reasons
                why I was able to go back to school
                and pursue to get more education again. <br><br>Some of my hobbies are watching movies and
                playing cozy games <i>("Spiritfarer", "Palia", "Sky: The Children of Light" and the like)</i>. I also
                have a passion
                with art and computer programming. I found it difficult to find how I'll be able to further my skills in
                both, but
                <strong>EUREKA!</strong> I found the perfect course which was <i>Software Development</i> which I found
                here through BYU-Pathway.
                I am actively looking to pursue a career in this field and hopefully to find a job at the end of
                finishing my degree.
